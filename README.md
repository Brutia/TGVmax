## Get the best from your TGVmax subscription
*If youâ€™re 16-27 years old and travel at least twice a month with TGV and IntercitÃ©s, TGVmax is for you. For just â‚¬79 per month, you can travel as often as you like.*  

The official definition above used to be true, it was awesome. However it becomes harder and harder to find a TGVmax seat available, especially for people who want to travel friday or sunday evening.

The process of booking a TGVmax seat now looks like that : 
- Connect to oui.sncf at midnight exactly 30 days before the date you want to travel ðŸ•›  
- If you're lucky, there is a seat available : book it immediatly and you're done âœ…  
- Otherwise, a seat may become available at random time during the next 30 days. So you need to connect as often as you can to oui.sncf and hope to find an available seat.

This process is boring and time consuming. This project is an attempt to make it fully automatic by creating TGVmax alerts.
